Don't Go Ape. Go Ape Tools. 
For when it all seems like too much work. 
## Image Gorilla

Generate your App Icons and Splashscreens in all the required sizes to get your app to market faster.

Note: this is the client side JS port of Ape Tools (which was originally server-side C#). This app uses VueJS with TypeScript.

If you are looking to contribute to development, all the magic happens in: https://github.com/webprofusion/apetools/blob/master/src/components/tools/tools.ts
